I began my career in 2012 as an Assistant Industrial Engineer at a US-based printing company, where I primarily focused on optimizing digital printing production processes. In 2016, I transitioned to another company as a Senior Industrial Engineer, responsible for factory design work in the South China region. From 2019 to 2022, I pursued a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering at Guangdong University of Technology. My research area was intelligent manufacturing system design, and during my graduate studies, I participated in a national fund project and two university-industry collaboration projects, playing significant roles in these research endeavors.
Since 2023, I have been working as a Senior Simulation Engineer at CALB Group, Ltd. My role involves optimizing production manufacturing processes through the development of intelligent algorithms and the utilization of industrial simulation tools. Throughout my six years of work experience and three years of graduate studies, I have successfully led or contributed to several medium to large-scale intelligent manufacturing projects, which have provided me with extensive experience in the field of industrial manufacturing.
Currently, I am particularly interested in digital twin technology, as it holds tremendous potential for application in the field of intelligent manufacturing. I aspire to make breakthroughs and innovations in this field through in-depth research and continuous learning.
