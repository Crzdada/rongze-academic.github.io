I began my career in 2012 as an Assistant Industrial Engineer at a US-based printing company, where my primary focus was optimizing digital printing production processes. In 2016, I transitioned to another company as a Senior Industrial Engineer, taking on the responsibility of factory design work in the South China region. From 2019 to 2022, I pursued a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering at Guangdong University of Technology, specializing in intelligent manufacturing system design. During my graduate studies, I actively participated in a national fund project and two university-industry collaboration projects, playing significant roles in these research endeavors.</br>
</br>
Since 2023, I have been working as a Senior Simulation Engineer at CALB Group, Ltd. In my current role, I am involved in optimizing production manufacturing processes through the development of intelligent algorithms and the utilization of industrial simulation tools. Over the course of my six years of work experience and three years of graduate studies, I have successfully led or contributed to several medium to large-scale intelligent manufacturing projects, gaining extensive experience in the field of industrial manufacturing.</br>
</br>
Currently, I am particularly interested in digital twin technology due to its immense potential for application in the field of intelligent manufacturing. I aspire to make breakthroughs and innovations in this field through in-depth research and continuous learning.
